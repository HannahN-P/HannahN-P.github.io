## Welcome to Hannah's GitPage

### About Me

I'm a senior at Virginia Tech, studying under the Computer Science major.  Due to past internships, I have experience with various testing methods and both independent and team-based full-cycle development.  After graduation, I hope to still be involved in research and development; my interests are cybersecurity and data structures.

In my free time, I enjoy building Magic the Gathering (MtG) decks and drawing.
