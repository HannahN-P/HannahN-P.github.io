## Welcome to Hannah's GitPage!
### About Me

I'm a senior at Virginia Tech, studying under the Computer Science major.  With past internships, I have experience with several testing methods and both independent and team-based full-cycle development.  After graduation, I hope to get an occupation involved in research and development; my interests are cybersecurity and data structures.

In my free time, I enjoy building Magic the Gathering (MtG) decks and drawing.
